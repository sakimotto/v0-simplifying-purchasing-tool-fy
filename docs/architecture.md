# Zervi Sourcing App - Architecture

## Application Architecture

The Zervi Sourcing App follows a modern React application architecture using Next.js App Router for routing and server components.

## Component Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with a focus on reusability and composition:

1. **Layout Components**
   - `MainLayout`: Provides the application shell with navigation
   - `SidebarProvider`: Manages sidebar state across the application

2. **Page Components**
   - Each page is a standalone component in the App Router structure
   - Pages use shared components for consistent UI

3. **UI Components**
   - Based on shadcn/ui library
   - Extended with custom components for specific needs
   - Follows a consistent design system

## Data Flow

The application currently uses a client-side data flow with mock data. Future implementations will include:

1. **Server Components**
   - Data fetching at the server level
   - Reduced client-side JavaScript

2. **API Routes**
   - RESTful API endpoints for data operations
   - Authentication and authorization

3. **State Management**
   - React Context for global state
   - Server actions for data mutations

## Routing

The application uses Next.js App Router for routing:

- File-based routing structure
- Nested layouts for consistent UI across routes
- Loading states for improved user experience

## Responsive Design

The application is designed to be fully responsive:

- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions for mobile devices

## Performance Considerations

- Component code splitting
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Optimized images and assets
- Server-side rendering for improved initial load time

## Security Considerations

Future implementations will include:

- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation
- CSRF protection
- Secure API endpoints
